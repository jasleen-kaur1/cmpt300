# CMPT 300: Operating Systems - Fall 2019

This course helped us understand what a modern operating system is, and the services it provides. We also discussed some basic issues in operating systems and were provided with solutions. Topics included multiprogramming, process management, memory management, and file systems. In this repository I have added some of the CMPT 300 assignments where I primarily used C.
